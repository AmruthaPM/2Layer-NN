# 2Layer-NN

## Overview

This project implements a simple 2-layer neural network from scratch using Python and Numpy.
The goal of this project is to provide a basic understanding of how neural networks work, 
including forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation.

## Installation

   ## Prerequisites

   - Python 3.x
   - Numpy
