# 2Layer-NN

## Overview

This project implements a simple 2-layer neural network from scratch using Python and Numpy.
The goal of this project is to provide a basic understanding of how neural networks work, 
including forward propagation, loss calculation, and backpropagation.

## Installation

   ## Prerequisites

   - Python 3.x
   - Numpy

- This project was inspired by a similar project found in the [Build your own x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) repository. Special thanks to the contributors of that repository 
for their guidance.
